# Theremino MCA
Nuclear Gamma and X-Ray Radiation - Multi Channel Analyzer Software (Creative Commons License)

In 2012, shortly after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan by the Theremino team, the "Theremino MCA" project began.

The project was meant to help create cheaper hardware and free software to assemble easily accessible measuring device that could be used to help distinguish naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) and technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials (TENORM) as well as to identify them.

Since I was one of the people involved in the design of software for measuring devices in Nuclear Physics, I joined the project and since its first published software version, my Isotope Identifier module has been implemented.
In the same project, I also participated in the design and testing of MCA hardware components.

The Isotope Identifier module is used to identify isotopes by means of a multi-channel graph analysis (Gamma Spectrometry) and to identify chemical elements by XRF (X-ray fluorescence).

My aliases under which I posted modules in the software are: Tomy, crnazvijezda, 9A5TOM.
